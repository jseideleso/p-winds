    "What we can conclude from this exercise is that, if we assume a Parker-wind like escape for HD 209458 b, solar abundances of C and O, and a solar-like high-energy spectrum for the host star, then the excess in-transit signature of neutral O will be about 0.5% in the core of the strongest O I line in the UV. For C II, a much promising signature stronger than 7.5% will be present in the strongest line of the transmission spectrum."
