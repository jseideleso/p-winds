    Calculates the distribution of electronic states of the different atomic shells

    In short, it calculates which fraction of the total number of H atoms are in the shell needed to produce H-alpha, H-beta etc lines.

    Parameters
    ----------

    Calculates the opacity for a specific Balmer line at a specific temperature considering the initial Voigt profile as input.
